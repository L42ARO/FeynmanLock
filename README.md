<h1> The FEYNMAN LOCK </h1>
Initially developed to be an RFID lock, the Feynman Lock eventually developed into a biometric lock that can be placed in a USF college dorm room.

<h3> Hardware used <h3>
<ul>
  <li>Arduino Nano</li>
  <li>MG996R Servo Motor </li>
  <li>FPM11A Fingerprint sensor</li>
  <li>RC522 RFID scanner </li>
</ul>

<h4>Mechanical Design Highlights</h4>
The point of connection between the servo motor and the actual door lock allows for a 60 degree angle of free movement, meaning that if the power of the building shuts off, the biometric lock won't prevent an user from regularly using a key to unlock the door.
